# Memey

I got bored lmao.

## Intro

Memey is a CLI meme generator using the ImgFlip API. It can be used to create memes on the fly.

## Installation

As a command line utility, it is recommended that you install this using NPM to get the most use out of it. The instructions below that it is installed this way to provide access to the `meme` command.

```
npm i -g memey
```

If you instead choose to clone this repo instead of installing it as an npm package, you can still run `npm i -g` from inside the project folder to gain access to the `meme` command. Alternatively, you can also use any of the following commands as `node index.js [params]` or `npm start [params]`.

## Usage

When installed using NPM, Memey will add the "meme" command to the PATH, allowing you to access it anywhere using the command line.

In order to start using Memey, you first need to create an account on <https://imgflip.com/>. Please note that this utility is meant for personal use only and that your login credentials will be stored in a JSON file in plain text. When you first install the project, run `meme login` to proceed to the login steps.

Once you have logged in, you can start using Memey to create memes. In order to do so, you must run the `meme` command and pass it three options.

- `s` - The search query. Memey will attempt to find a meme that matches the results.
- `t` (optional)* - The Top text.
- `b` (optional)* - The Bottom text.

*While the top and bottom texts are both optional, at least one _must_ be provided.

#### Example

```
meme -s "dr evil" -t "quangdao can" -b "\"code\""
```

Memey comes with built-in shorthand for certain memes. These are typically the memes whose text are generally in a similar format. For example, the "all the things" meme typically has text that resembles something like, "Milk all the cows!". Memes like this can be generated by omitting the flags altogether and providing the text. Memey will automagically figure out how to interpret the meme and supply the arguments.

#### Example

```
meme "what if i told you this app was made out of boredom"
```

## Maintenance

In order to reduce the strain on ImgFlip's servers, all meme data is stored locally in a JSON file. Therefore, it may not always be fully up-to-date. To fetch the latest meme data from ImgFlip, you can run `meme update`. Note that instead of overriding the locally stored memes with ImgFlip's data, the retrieved memes are merged into the existing meme JSON. This is done to keep existing memes, because ImgFlip only returns the 100 most popular ones.
